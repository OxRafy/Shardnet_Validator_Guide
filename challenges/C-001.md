# Setup NEAR-CLI `Challenge 001`

In this part, you need to install `NEAR-CLI` first before running your validator, because it takes a shardnet wallet that must be used to make transactions.


1. Update && Upgrade software

    ```bash
    sudo su
    ```

    ```bash
    cd
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

2. Set port and enable the function

    ```bash
    ufw allow ssh/tcp && ufw allow http/tcp && ufw allow https/tcp && ufw enable
    ```
    Check your port status, make sure the status is active
    
    ```bash
    ufw status
    ```

3. Install NodeJs, and NPM

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -  

    sudo apt install build-essential 
    
    sudo apt install nodejs

    PATH="$PATH"
    ```
    
    <img width="1000" alt="Installation" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73088644/181150275-c3e3acf2-2a33-4222-a55c-6c74fc0122c6.png">
    
4. Check version of your `NodeJs` and `NPM`

    Make sure the version that has been installed is the latest version
    
    ```bash
    node -v
    ```
      >v18.6.0

    ```bash
    npm -v
    ```
      >8.13.2

    <img width="300" alt="check_version" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73088644/181151428-2c09be70-3d70-4b34-9e21-a3a32ee7154d.png">
    
    - Update `NPM` to version `8.15.0` (Optional)  :

    ```bash
    npm install -g npm@8.15.0
    ```
    
5. Install NEAR-CLI

    Install NEAR-CLI to use your wallet in the validator section later
    
    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g near-cli
    ```
    
6. Change NEAR Environment to Shardnet

    ```bash
    export NEAR_ENV=shardnet
    ```
    
    ```bash
    echo 'export NEAR_ENV=shardnet' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

## Useful Command

- Check Proposal List

    In this section you can see a list of proposals whether accepted or rejected (you can check later after creating a validator).
    
    - Check all proposals
        
        ```bash
        near proposals
        ```
    
    - Find a proposal

        Change `xx` with your wallet name (for example: test.factory.shardnet.near)
        
        ```bash
        near proposals | grep xx.factory.shardnet.near
        ```
     
- Check Active Validators
        
    You can see a list of validators that are currently active (You can check this when your validators are active)
    
    - Check all active validators
        
         ```bash
        near validators current
        ```
    - Find an active validator
    
        Change `xx` with your wallet name (for example: test.factory.shardnet.near)
        
        ```bash
        near validators current | grep xx.factory.shardnet.near
        ```
        
- Chack the next validators

     In this section you can see validators whose proposals have been accepted and will become active in the next epoch (If the proposal has been accepted, it will appear in this section later after the previous epoch is finished).
     
     - Check the next validators

        ```bash
        near validators next
        ```
        
     - Check the next validator specifically

        Change `xx` with your wallet name (for example: test.factory.shardnet.near)

        ```bash
        near validators next | grep xx.factory.shardnet.near
        ```
