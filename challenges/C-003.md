## Mounting Staking Pool `(Challenge 003)`

At this stage you will create a validator that will run on the shardnet.

1. Create Staking Pool Contract

     ```bash
    near call factory.shardnet.near create_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_id": "wallet_name", "owner_id": "xx.shardnet.near", "stake_public_key": "your_public_key", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 5, "denominator": 100}, "code_hash":"DD428g9eqLL8fWUxv8QSpVFzyHi1Qd16P8ephYCTmMSZ"}' --accountId="xx.shardnet.near" --amount=30 --gas=300000000000000
    ```
    
    Change `wallet_name`,`xx` and `public_key` with yours
   
    
    `--amount=30` you can change the number of your NEAR stakes from 30 to whatever you want (because 30 is the minimum stake), 1 wallet has 500 NEAR but you better leave NEAR (more is better) to pay gas fee later. However, to determine how much NEAR is needed, you can check the seat price [here](https://explorer.shardnet.near.org/nodes/validators).
   
   
2. The result will be like this if you have finished doing all the commands above

3. Check your validator on shardnet explorer\

    https://explorer.shardnet.near.org/nodes/validators
    
## Useful Command
    
##### Change Comission
    
```bash
near call xx.factory.shardnet.near update_reward_fee_fraction '{"reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 3, "denominator": 100}}' --accountId xx.shardnet.near --gas=300000000000000
```

Change `numerator` parameter as you want. The command above is to change the commission to 3%, if you want to change it to 5% then you change the `numerator` parameter to be 5

##### Deposit and Stake NEAR

```bash
near call xx.factory.shardnet.near deposit_and_stake --amount your_NEAR --accountId xx.shardnet.near --gas=300000000000000
```

Change `your_NEAR` with the amount of NEAR you want to deposit ( For example: `--amount 10` )


##### How to Unstake

```bash
near call xx.factory.shardnet.near unstake '{"amount": "amount_of_yoctoNEAR"}' --accountId xx.shardnet.near --gas=300000000000000
```

`amount_of_yoctoNEAR` change with amount that you want to unstake in yoctoNEAR ( For example: ``{"amount: "100000000000000000"} ``)

NB: 1 NEAR = 1000000000000000000000000 yoctoNEAR

For Unstake all your NEAR, run this command:

```bash
near call xx.factory.shardnet.near unstake_all --accountId xx.shardnet.near --gas=300000000000000
```

##### Withdraw

Unstaking will take 2 - 3 epoch until it can be withdrawn to the wallet

```bash
near call xx.factory.shardnet.near withdraw '{"amount": "amount_of_yoctoNEAR"}' --accountId xx.shardnet.near --gas=300000000000000
```

Run this command for withdaw all NEAR:

```bash
near call xx.factory.shardnet.near withdraw_all --accountId xx.shardnet.near --gas=300000000000000
```

##### Ping

Command:

```bash
near call xx.factory.shardnet.near ping '{}' --accountId xx.shardnet.near --gas=300000000000000
```

Balances Total Balance Command :

```bash
near view xx.factory.shardnet.near get_account_total_balance '{"account_id": "xx.shardnet.near"}'
```

##### Staked Balance

Command:

```bash
near view xx.factory.shardnet.near get_account_staked_balance '{"account_id": "xx.shardnet.near"}'
```

##### Unstaked Balance

Command:

```bash
near view xx.factory.shardnet.near get_account_unstaked_balance '{"account_id": "xx.shardnet.near"}'
```

##### Available for Withdrawal

You only can withdraw your NEAR if the token is unlocked

Command:

```bash
near view xx.factory.shardnet.near is_account_unstaked_balance_available '{"account_id": "xx.shardnet.near"}'
```

##### Pause / Resume Staking

###### Pause
Command:

```bash
near call xx.factory.shardnet.near pause_staking '{}' --accountId xx.shardnet.near
```

###### Resume

Command:

```bash
near call xx.factory.shardnet.near resume_staking '{}' --accountId xx.shardnet.near
```
